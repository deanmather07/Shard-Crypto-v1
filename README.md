# Shard-Crypto-v1
Shard-based cryptographic concepts exploring entropy distribution, distortion, Titanium security profiles, and deceptive failure behaviors.
Shard Crypto v1

Built by Dean Mather, in collaboration with ChatGPT (OpenAI).

Shard Crypto v1 documents a collection of cryptographic concepts developed
through human–AI collaboration. The focus is on moving away from
single-key security models toward shard-based entropy distribution
and distortion-based protection.

Status: CONCEPT / RESEARCH / ARCHITECTURE
Not production-ready. Requires implementation, testing, and
independent cryptographic audit.• Shard-based security concepts
• Shard-1, Shard-2, and Shard-3 evolution
• Shard entanglement (no single secret exists)
• Titanium security profiles:
  - T1: strong & fast
  - T2: reduced key exposure
  - T3: distortion-based security
• Failure behaviors:
  - Clean Fail
  - Pure Poison
  - Hybrid
• Paranoia concepts (escalated distrust under suspicious conditions)• Shards are not keys
• Partial success gives no advantage
• Correct math does not guarantee truth
• Proven primitives (AES, hashes, KDFs) are used as tools, not replacedThis repository contains architectural ideas and cryptographic concepts only.
Nothing here should be used in production without full implementation,
testing, and professional security audit.
